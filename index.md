### Research Statement 

Greetings! My name is Thomas Burke and I am a second year Interactive Arts and Science student at Brock University. For means of this course, my research interest is in media archaeology. My research presentation reflects this interest, as it is the project I enjoyed working on the most. I found it interesting researching a now irrelevant piece of technology that clearly had great effect on the devices we have today. Through continuing work in media archaeology in the future, researching more about past media forms, and making connections to media forms of today, I would aim to predict trends in future media technology that could benefit myself, and others in the field.

					<h2>Carphones</h2>
					
					<p>Technology of the future from the past so really it's just old technology...</p>

					<p>This is a Carphone</p>
					
					<aside class="notes">Exactly what it sounds like, a Carphone is a phone for your car. The idea of a dedicated phone for your car may seem strange nowadays, but they were once seen as a great innovation, and even a status symbol. Carphone's started becoming mainstream around the 1970's, remained popular during the 1980's, and started to die in the 1990's as personal cell phones became more popular.</aside>

					<h2>Cellphones of the 80's</h2>
					<p>required more power to transmit (car batteries)</p>
					<p>long, dedicated antennas (car antenna)</p>
					<p>best signal quality outside (cars drive outside)</p>
					
					<aside class="notes">Carphone's during that time required much more power to function compared to cellphones of today, that power requirement was sated by a car battery. Also, due to the cell signal infrastructure of the time, both long antenna's and the great outdoors were requirements for making quality mobile phone calls. </aside>
			
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>But what about before cell technology?</h2>
					
					<aside class="notes">Before cell service infrastructure, Carphone's used radio frequencies to make calls. However this was quite expensive, as each Carphone would be assigned its own frequency, meaning there could be only few cardphones in close proximity to function properly. In addition, those signals were not in any way private. This lead to early car phones being seen as a status symbol, and usually were only installed in high end cars. </aside>

					<p>well that looks safe!</p>
					
					<aside class="notes">The earliest mention of a Carphone I could find was created in 1910 by a guy named Lars Magnus Ericsson, an engineer from Sweden. His Carphone functioned by connecting two long electrical wires to telephone poles alongside the road. His idea however, did not take off in popularity, and it wasnâ€™t until the 1940s and 50s, through advancements in technology that cardphones had begun to be seen installed in cars. </aside>

					<aside class="notes">The Carphone was the answer to a need. The need to make and receive phone calls while out and about, away from your house. Because before, phones were in a stationary place, connected by a wire,  to a home. People are mobile creatures, we go out and about, move around, visit places and people regularly, and a stationary telephone is contrary to that lifestyle, and created the need for the Carphone. </aside>

					<p>This is a phone car, not a car phone</p>
					
					<aside class="notes">The 1980s can be referred to as the golden age of the car phone, as the technology would be more affordable and accessible than the cardphones of the 1970's which saw limited availability and high prices, and still having an advantage over the upcoming hand portable phones of the 1990s that would push the Carphone out of popularity. The 1980s Carphone would be a must have for a business man of the era. </aside>

					<p>Martin and his phones</p>
					
					<aside class="notes">Of course, the Carphone still had mobile limitations, the phone is still wired to the car. Those limitations are what pushed Martin Cooper, a Motorola researcher and executive to develop the first truly mobile phone, making the first phone call from a hand-held phone call in 1973. The phone weighed two and a half pounds was 10 inches long, and had a 20 minute battery life. </aside>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<img src="https://unionwirelessnews.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/martin-cooper-quote.jpg"/>
					
					<aside class="notes">That first hand-help phone call made by Martin Cooper was made to one of his competitors, in which he told them he was calling from a completely mobile, hand held phone. This would start a fierce research and development race and rivalry, which would power the swift development, and innovation of hand-held cellphone technology, and eventually lead to phones of today. </aside>

					<p>Martin Cooper is the car phone killer</p>
					
					<aside class="notes">The 1990's saw the eventual downfall of the Carphone, as hand held phones, due to advancements in technology, overcame the limitations that held them behind car phones. Sporting a respectable battery life, and comparable call quality, the truly mobile phone of the 90s would finally push ahead of the Carphone. </aside>

					<aside class="notes">From a present day perspective, we can see the Carphone as a stepping stone in cellphone technology. The Carphone pushed the telephone out of the home, and would take the telephone industry towards a mobile mindset, which would eventually lead to the smartphones we all carry with us present day. An important step in phone development. </aside>

					<aside class="notes">The Carphone is a good example of how innovation builds on what we already have. Mobile phones where an innovation inspired by the car phone, the Carphone was built on the back of existing telephone technology, and telephone technology was an innovation in communication that improved upon the sending of letters.</aside>

					<aside class="notes">I think it is an interesting thought that cars are kind of closely related to the development of mobile phone technology. The car was the most convenient way to support a mobile phone at the time, providing an answer to the limitations of the time. In an alternate reality without cars, we would still have phones, but would mobile phone technology be where it is for us today?</aside>

					<aside class="notes">From a modern day perspective, the prospect of having a phone in your car with its sole purpose to make calls while driving seems dangerous, and would be illegal in an increasingly more amount of places. Distracted driving is a big modern day problem, perhaps because of how much more interactive our devices are, compared to an 80s Carphone.</aside>

					<aside class="notes">Seeing the limitations of these old Car phones, and comparing them to the modern day smartphone, Its neat to me to see how much telephone technology has changed in a relatively  short time, and seeing the connections between certain technologies. Through researching, I gained perspective, and respect for the mobile devices we use today, and often take for granted. </aside>
